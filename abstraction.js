// ABSTRACTION means hiding the implementation details and showing only behavior. Itâ€™s done on the design level as opposed to encapsulation which is implemented at the application level. With abstraction, only essential details are shown to the user.

// SAMPLE 1 via CLASS

class Employee{
    #name;
    #baseSalary;
    #bunos;

    setName(val){
        this.#name = val;
    }
    setBaseSalary(val, bunos){
        this.#baseSalary = val;
        this.#bunos = bunos;
    }

    getName(){
        return this.#name;
    }

    getSalary(){
        return this.#baseSalary + this.#bunos;
    }
}

let employee = new Employee();

employee.setName("Carlo");
employee.setBaseSalary(100, 500);
console.log(employee.getName());
console.log(employee.getSalary());
